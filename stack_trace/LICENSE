// The modifications made to work outside of the Chromium project lead to
// dropping thread safe policies, since this is targetting a single thread
// applications, namely the modified versions of OpenFOAM 1.7.x and newer,
// being done by FSD blueCAPE Lda in Portugal, from 2010 till 2017.
//
// Additional changes were made based on the example information provided here:

//
// There are also code excerpts from MSDN examples, indicated in the respective
// comments in the code.
